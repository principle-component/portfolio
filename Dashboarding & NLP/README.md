This project explores combining data from financial markets as well as sentiment from the posts of Reddit users, 
ideally empowering end-users to be able to find correlations and possible predictors of market changes. The dashboard 
includes features to enable automatic predictions about whether prices will rise when it is filtered. The sentiment and 
topic detection data is more static, as it was not practical to reprocess with each filter change.

API keys have been removed, this is purely demonstration code.
