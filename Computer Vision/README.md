This project explores the possibility of using local machine learning resources to discern between real and counterfeit 
artwork. The works were sourced from the internet, following the high-profile case of Wolfgang Beltracchi who forged 
the works of Heinrich Campendonk. Research had shown deep learning methods to be effective at this task, however such
models can be expensive to train and thus I wanted to see if there were viable lower-cost options.

Source images have been excluded from this upload, this code is for demonstration of the idea only. The result of the 
experiment was that the options explored were not successful at reliably detecting art forgery.
